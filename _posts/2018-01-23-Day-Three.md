I am sure everyone is very curious to see what happened today for the five currencies and how the forecasted numbers or price levels worked.
Let us start with the BRITISH POUND or currency pair GBPUSD as I write it is at 1.4002
It came down from opening price of 1.3979 to 1.3913 and went all the way up to 1.4027 a total of 140 points were
 crossed in 2 downward and one upward movement.The forecast number 1.3920 was very close to 1.3913 and could have 
been used as an indication as the low of the day with a target high of 1.3955 which crossed at which point a take profit order
could have been given for waiting for the day.

Now let us see what the Euro or EURUSD did today.It started open from 1.2259 and came down to 1.2221 and went up to 1.2305
then came down to 1.2268 and went upto 1.2300.
The forecasted numbers from yesterday 1.2270 was very close to one of the later lows 1.2268. The low of the day 1.2221 was
very close to the predicted low from yesterday of 1.2210. The high of the day 1.2305 was very close to the predicted number 1.2302.
All these movements may have given us nearly 100 points of profit from the EURO price movements.

We will now see what were the movements traced by the JAPANESE YEN

YEN opened at around 110.88 came down to 110.52 and went all the way up to a high of 111.16 following this fell all the way to 110.26
and looks like it will close at around there.
Predicted number form yesterday 110.54 is very close to onnne of the early lows 110.52 and the high of 111.16 is very close to one of the 
forecasted numbers 111.25. Following this price came through 110.86 and also 110.54 which gave indications for further shorting and profit taking.
A total of 90 points of profit may have been achieved from USDJPY if followed through.

SWISSFRANC OR USDCHF Opened at  0.9621 and went to a high of 0.9633 following which fell to a low of 0.9565 

The forecasted levels of 0.9632 and 0.9641 are  very close to 0.9633 and price falling through the predicted low of 0.9592 are significant.

AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR AUDUSD DID THE FOLLOWING

It opened at 0.8015 and went a short move upto 0.8028 following which fell all the way down to  0.7955 and went up back to 0.8000.
The forecasted numbers 0.7996 and 0.8020 were very close to some of the main levels today. A fall through 0.7985 may be an 
indication to short the pair.
