We are on the first day of the fourth week of this year the second week of this blog this day is 29 January 2018.

Let us look at what the five currencies have done today.

**GBPUSD**  
Let us first look at the Great British pound which opened with a downward gap of 20 points at 1.4133 and went briefly upto 1.4157 closing the gap following which made a low of 1.4110. It then went back to 1.4147 and made various lower lows at 1.4090, 1.4072 & 1.4024. 

The numbers 1.4070, 1.4099 and 1.4114 from yesterdays forecasted prices are very close and useful to trade.

**EURUSD**  
Opened at 1.2424 went up to 1.2431 and then wnet up and down between the following price levels - 1.2384, 1.2428, 1.2343, and 1.2336, and finally went up to 1.2388. 

The forecasted prices 1.2382,1.2393 and 1.2362 were useful. 

**USDCHF**  
It opened at 9336 came initially down to 9329 and then it went three times up and three times down. 0.9376, 0.9355, 0.9380, 0.9342, 0.9380, 0.9366 and then went up to 0.9378. 

The predicted prices 0.9385,0.9369,0.9361 were useful for trading.

**USDJPY**
The Japanese YEN opened at 108.66 following which it went between 108.50, 108.95, 108.66, 109.03, 108.61 and 109.17.

The prices predicted yesterday 109.16 and 109.04 were useful and would have delivered 97 PIPS profit.

**AUDUSD**  
Opened at 0.8098 and then moved range bound between 0.8100 and 0.8076 over six times giving a possibility of over 100 PIPS.

0.8097 and 0.8064 are close to the range of prices 0.8118 and 0.8076.

We can see that all currencies had a range bound movement and did not make any major highs or lows. In the coming days it may suddenly come out of the range and shoot up or down.

The numbers for tomorrow are as following,

**GBPUSD** | 1.4073 | 1.4141 | 1.4118 | 1.4107 | 1.4005 | 1.4028 | 1.4039 | 1.4083
