Today can be a very surprising day for most of the people as most of the five currencies have moved over 100 points or PIPS as they are called in the foreign exchange trading bussiness which is a 4 trillion dollar daily turn over financial market oppurtunity which is more than annual GDP of most countries in the world.

Let us see how the BRITISH DOLLAR behaved today. It has opened around 1.4000 and went almost in a straight line to 1.4228 this is a straight upward move without much stop anywhere to a price level over 228 pips upwards. We can see that today the british pound has not moved down and it has gone way beyond the predicted prices I gave yesterday. In the coming days you will find that most days pound is not going anywhere near 200 pips in a day. Today is an exceptional day.

The predicted low prices were not hit obviously. The predicted high prices 1.4050,1.4028 were both hit and the price went up through it.
Just making the long trades and sitting around would have given you at least 200 pips or points.

Let us look into the continent of europe by looking at the movements of the EURO or currency pair of EURUSD. It has opened at 1.2295 and went a short distance down to 1.2288. Following this, it has mostly gone up stopping at 1.2316 1.2333 and 1.2350   414. This is a total of 114 pips or points of profit.

If you think about the prices I have predicted yesterday or forecasted you may see that the EURO has went over 100 points 
which is exceptional for the currency to move in a day. The prices for EURUSD which I predicted yesterday 1.2334,1.2316,1.2247 were as you can see very close to the levels the price stopped on. If a long trade was started from one of these price levels 
all the profits up to the hugh price of 1.2414 could have been bagged.

The people in the land of the rising sun JAPAN should be fast asleep now but let us see if the YEN was also very 
active and predictable like the other currencies. The USDJPY opened at 110.29 and then went down all the way to 108.92. This is over 130 pips.

USDJPY has briefly stopped at 110.08, 109.78 109.58 109.34 and also around 109.20 before plunging all the way to 108.92.
As we can see obviously it did not hit the high predicted prices of the day but is has gone via the forecasted prices of 110.06 and 109.78.

An entry at any of the above two prices and waiting would have given the rest of the downward move as profit. 
If people are not used to the concept of selling a currency or going short, this can be explained in one of the meetings or another day.

But the important thing to remember is that even if the price is going down, profits can be made by selling the currency and later buying it back.

The SWISSFRANK is the stable currency to wich all investment goes in the event of a financial crash.
Let us now see what has happened for SWITZERLAND? 

USDCHF opened at 0.9575 and went down all the way to 0.9437 this is a total of 118 points or PIPS. There were some supports or slowing down of price move at 0.9555, 0.9508 and finally at 0.9445. Let us see if the prices predicted yesterday may help us to bag at least some of the total 118 points of the day. The predicted prices .0.9562, 0.9546 and 0.9516 were very close to 0.9508 and 0.9555.

If the predicted prices were used as entries to shorting or selling the currency for the day it may have been profitable.

What has AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR done today? To put it simply it has almost followed an upward line from 0.8000 to 0.8080 which is a total of 80 pips. It has opened at 0.7996, and briefly dropped to 0.7990 following which it has gone upwards and stopped briefly at 0.8014 and 0.8030, this was followed by higher prices of 0.8060 and 0.8083. Prices 0.8018 0.8039 were very close to the high prices 0.8014 and 0.8030 it went to following which it went further high which I did not anticipate.
